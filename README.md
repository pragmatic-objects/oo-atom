OO-atom is a desperate attempt to make Java programming more predictable and transparent.

OO-atom operates with the term named Atom. Atom is a Java class, which follows a strict set of [requirements](https://github.com/project-avral/oo-atom/wiki/What-is-Atom). Following these requirements for all (or at least most of) the Java classes in your project, you'll get a code which is:
- composable
- easy to test
- SOLID/cohesive
- highly reusable

## Disclaimer
The project is in early proof-of-concept stage. Everything may be changed at any time later.
